A fairly quick and simple mod, that came about because I always thought arrows were too expensive in the vanilla game - especially when you're just starting out.  Now, when you enter the barter menu with a merchant, arrows in their stock will be grouped in sheaves of 12 (configurable), and the price of the sheaf will be 50% (also configurable) of the cost of buying 12 individual arrows.  Any remaining arrows will remain, and be listed singly.

For example, when I was testing with a new character, a single Iron Arrow cost 3 gold.  That's [i]36 gold[/i] just to get a dozen arrows!  With this mod, those 12 arrows can be bought as a single sheaf, at a cost of 18 gold.

Note that this doesn't affect the [i]total[/i] number of arrows a merchant has - if they had 27 before, they'll still have 27 now, it's just there will be 2 sheaves of 12, and 5 individual arrows.

When you exit the barter menu, all sheaves are converted back to individual arrows.

Should be pretty good, since everything is done on-the-fly via scripts at the point you start bartering. Arrows and bolts added by other mods should be fine.

Of course, since it's script driven, there can be a delay before you see the arrows grouped together.  Usually less than a second, but as ever it depends how busy the script engine is at the time.

There are two Global Variables that control behaviour:

[i]_AS_ArrowsInSheaf[/i] - What it says: how many arrows go in one sheaf.  Default is 12 (I tried 24, which is the historical quota for a sheaf, but merchants don't usually have that many, so I wasn't seeing any benefit)

[i]_AS_SheafValueMult[/i] - How much the cost of the sheaf is compared with buying individual arrows.  Default is 0.5, meaning 50% of the price. Note this is a multiplier, not a discount - ie, smaller values mean a smaller resulting cost.

I didn't include an MCM with this one, as I thought it wasn't worth it for just two options.  They can be set any time via the console, using the 'set [i]var[/i] to [i]value[/i]' command - eg:
[font=Courier New][quote]set _AS_ArrowsInSheaf to 10[/quote][/font]will start using sheaves of 10.

SKSE v1.7.3 (get it from [url=http://skse.silverlock.org]skse.silverlock.org[/url]).  I had to write a couple of new SKSE functions for this, so you'll need it..
(I've added these functions to my existing [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/78986]Inventory Functions[/url] SKSE plugin - it's included with this mod, but also hosted standalone if anyone has a use for the functions).


That's about it - like I said, a fairly quick and simple mod.
